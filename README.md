# Virtual_Classroom
A terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager that handles class scheduling, student attendance, and assignment submissions.
## Implementation
* The command "add_classroom" followed by a class name serves as a prompt to initiate the creation of a virtual classroom within an educational software system. It triggers the system to validate the class name's uniqueness and permissions, followed by the setup of a digital classroom environment. Once created, this virtual classroom can be customized and managed to facilitate online learning, with instructors and students using it for lectures, assignments, and collaboration.
* User types add_student followed by the student ID and the class name to enroll a student in a classroom.
* User types schedule_assignment followed by class name and assignment details to add an assignment for a class.
* User types submit_assignment followed by student ID, class name, and assignment details to mark an assignment as submitted.
