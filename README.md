# Virtual_Classroom
A terminal-based Virtual Classroom Manager that handles class scheduling, student attendance, and assignment submissions.
The command "add_classroom" followed by a class name serves as a prompt to initiate the creation of a virtual classroom within an educational software system. It triggers the system to validate the class name's uniqueness and permissions, followed by the setup of a digital classroom environment. Once created, this virtual classroom can be customized and managed to facilitate online learning, with instructors and students using it for lectures, assignments, and collaboration.
